**Purpose**

The End of Term Web Archive captures and saves U.S. Government websites at the end of
presidential administrations. The EOT has thus far preserved websites from
administration changes in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

**Archive Scope**

The End of Term Web Archive contains federal government websites (.gov, .mil, etc) in the
Legislative, Executive, or Judicial branches of the government. Websites that were at risk of
changing (i.e., whitehouse.gov) or disappearing altogether during government transitions were
captured. Local government websites, or any other site not part of the federal government domain
were out of scope.

**U.S. Federal Government Domain End of Term 2024 Web Archive**

For the End of Term 2024, The Library of Congress, University of North Texas Libraries,
Internet Archive, Stanford University Libraries, U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) joined efforts again to preserve public United States Government
websites at the conclusion of the presidential administration ending January 20, 2025. This web
harvest -- like its predecessors in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 -- is intended to document the federal
government's presence on the World Wide Web during the transition of presidential
administrations and to enhance the existing collections of the partner institutions.

This broad comprehensive crawl of the .gov domain includes as many federal .gov sites as we
could find, plus federal content in other domains (such as .mil, .com, and social media content)
and FTP'd datasets.

Nominations made by individual URL for inclusion in the End of Term Presidential Harvest 2024

URLs submitted for consideration in bulk form via files were added to a separate
[bulk Nomination Tool instance][bulk_nominated]. The files containing the bulk list URLs
have also been added to a [GitHub repository][eot2020_github].
