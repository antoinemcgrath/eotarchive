**Purpose**

The End of Term Web Archive captures and saves U.S. Government websites at the end of
presidential administrations. Beginning in 2008, the EOT has thus far preserved websites from
administration changes in 2008, 2012 and 2016.

**Archive Scope**

The End of Term Web Archive contains federal government websites (.gov, .mil, etc) in the
Legislative, Executive, or Judicial branches of the government. Websites that were at risk of
changing (i.e., whitehouse.gov) or disappearing altogether during government transitions were
captured. Local government websites, or any other site not part of the federal government domain
were out of scope.

**U.S. Federal Government Domain End of Term 2020 Web Archive**

For the End of Term 2020, The Library of Congress, University of North Texas Libraries,
Internet Archive, Stanford University Libraries, and the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO)
are joining efforts again, this time with new partners Environmental Data & Governance Initiative
(EDGI) and the General Services Administration (GSA), to preserve public United States Government
websites at the end of the current presidential administration ending January 20, 2021. This web
harvest -- like its predecessors in 2008, 2012, and 2016 -- is intended to document the federal
government’s presence on the World Wide Web during the transition of Presidential
administrations and to enhance the existing collections of the partner institutions.
This broad comprehensive crawl of the .gov domain will include as many federal .gov sites as we
can find, plus federal content in other domains (such as .mil, .com, and social media content)
and FTP’d datasets.
