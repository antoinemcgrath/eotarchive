environmental data, websites, institutions, and policy seeking to improve environmental
data stewardship and to promote environmental health and environmental justice.

### Internet Archive (IA)

The [Internet Archive (IA)][ia] is a 502(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an internet
library offering permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities,
and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and
located in San Francisco, IA's collections include texts, audio, moving images, television, and
software as well as archived web pages. IA participates in the NDIIPP program and is a founding
member of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance.

### Library of Congress (LOC)

The [Library of Congress][loc] has been archiving the web since 2000, with collections focusing on
sites of Legislative Branch agencies, U.S. House and Senate offices and committees, and U.S.
national election campaigns, among other thematic collections. More information about the
Library's Web Archiving program is available at the
[Library of Congress Web Archives page][loc_web_archives].

### Stanford University Libraries (SUL)

Joining the End of Term project in 2016, [Stanford University Libraries][sul]
has been archiving the Web for over 15 years, and are active
members of the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), National Digital Stewardship

the institutional legacy and research and learning output of the university as well as at-risk
sites like Iranian blogs, FOIA sites, Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports, fugitive US
agencies, bay area governments and the CA .gov domain. Stanford’s Web archiving program is a
growing complement to the library’s robust collection building activities. The library stores web
archives locally in the Stanford Digital Repository, provides discovery through its catalog, and
enables browsing through a local instance of the Wayback web archive replay platform.

### University of North Texas Libraries (UNT)

The [University of North Texas Libraries][unt] began web archiving in 1997, when, as part of the
Federal Depository Library Program, they created the [CyberCemetery][cybercemetery] to capture
and provide permanent public access to the web sites and publications of defunct U.S. government
agencies and commissions. UNT also participates in the NDIIPP program and is a founding member of
the National Digital Stewardship Alliance. More information about the UNT Libraries web archiving
activities can be found at the following link: [About Web Archiving at UNT][unt_web_archiving].

### U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO)

The [U.S. Government Publishing Office][gpo] manages the Federal Depository Library Program and is
charged with providing permanent public access to government publications. Access to the Federal
Depository Library Program Web Archive is located [here][fdlp_archive].

### U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
