# End of Term 2008 Dataset

The End of Term 2008 Dataset represents data collected by four collecting institutions. These institutions were the California Digital Library (CDL), the Internet Archive (IA),
the Library of Congress (LOC) and the University of North Texas Libraries (UNT). The data is part of the initiative called the End of Term Presidential Web Archive.  

## Archive Location and Download

The 2008 End of Term archive is located on the **eotarchive** bucket at [EOT-2008](https://eotarchive.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/EOT-2008/index.html).

To assist with exploring and using the dataset, we provide gzipped files which list all segments, WARC, WAT, WET, and CDX files.

By adding either **s3://eotarchive/** or **https://eotarchive.s3.amazonaws.com/** to each line, you end up with the s3 and HTTP paths respectively.
